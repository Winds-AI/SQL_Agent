I've implemented several optimizations to further improve the execution time of your SQL queries:

Query Caching System:
Added a QueryCache class that stores results of SELECT queries with a 5-minute TTL (Time-To-Live)
The cache uses MD5 hashing of queries as keys for efficient lookup
Cache size is limited to 100 entries by default, with LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy
Only SELECT queries are cached since they're read-only operations
Optimized Query Execution:
The system now checks the cache before executing any query
For repeated identical queries, results are returned immediately from cache
Cache hits are logged for monitoring performance improvements
Prepared Statements:
Added support for prepared statements through psycopg2's internal handling
This reduces SQL parsing overhead for frequently executed queries
Reduced Debug Output:
Removed some unnecessary debug print statements to improve performance
These optimizations work alongside your existing connection pooling system. Now when the same query is executed multiple times (like "show me the sample data of jobs table"), the second and subsequent executions will be significantly faster as they'll be served from the cache.

The system maintains all the logging functionality you had before, with additional logging for cache hits. This should dramatically reduce the total execution time for repeated queries, which is common in interactive SQL exploration.

Would you like to test these changes by running the same query twice to see the performance improvement?
